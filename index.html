        <h3>The exam discussion!</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li>It's once in a week normally.</li>

        <div id= "main-info"><p>
            Every meeting day we all will come in one of our meeting link and discuss about the upcoming exam. I think that both of you study on your own without your parents' help. If you do, then you may also do with your friends' now. Please consider this and let's look forward to this opinion.<br>It's a nice and producive way of interacting and using our time wisely. Of course, we will all log off in at exam time and write the exam ourselves. But it would be so nice if we all can do this. Mainly, instead of talking and meeting in calls or chatting or keeping voice messages, we can talk directly here. Let me know later ok? About your opinion.
